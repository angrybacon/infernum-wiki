## What are Legions?

Legions are the armies which capture cantons, conquer Places of Power, and
assault rival Archfiends. At the start of a match, each Archfiend will only
control their personal guard. The most common way to gain new Legions is to
purchase them through the Bazaar. Purchased Legions will spawn in a randomly
chosen canton closest to your stronghold. The maximum number of Legions an
Archfiend can control at once is equal to their command rating, which is
primarily determined by the power of Wrath. If the Legions they control is at or
above their command rating, any attempt to gain more Legions will fail.

## Legion Stats

Legions begin with a predetermined array of stats, however these can change over
the course of a match whether it be through Promotions, Manuscripts, or Rituals.

**Level**: A legion's level determines how many attachment slots it has,
increases resistance to hostile rituals that target it, and grants a Promotion
on each level up which boosts chosen stats. Legions gain 1 xp for each defeated
hostile legion and will level up after gaining X xp, where X is their current
level. Legions at level 7 will require 13 xp to level up.

**Movement**: Each legion can only move a certain amount of cantons per turn.
See [Movement][movement] for more details.

**Hit Points**: HP determines the amount of damage a legion can take before
being destroyed. Certain legions, such as personal guards, can return either
through waiting or a ritual.

**Combat Stats**: The Ranged, Melee, and Infernal stats determine the strength
of a legion in each of the respective combat phases.

**Special Abilities**: Some legions have innate special abilities, and all
legions can be granted abilities through various other sources. These can
provide advantages outside of combat, like teleportation, or create advantages
during combat, like changing the order of combat phases.

**Attachment Slots**: Legions have a number of attachment slots equal to half
their level rounded up, to a maximum of four slots. Attachments can grant
powerful bonuses and abilities. See [Attachments][attachments] for more details.

## Titans

Certain legions are so powerful they can be called a Titan. In addition to a
hefty price tag at the Bazaar, titans have a tribute upkeep that must be paid
each turn, or else it is lost as if it was destroyed. However, they have
tremendous combat prowess and other powerful abilities. Note that Titans are
still legions, and can be affected by everything that affects legions, with the
exception that they cannot be the sacrifice of the Witness the Martyr ritual.
