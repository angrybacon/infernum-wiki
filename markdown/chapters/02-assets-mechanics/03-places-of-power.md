## What are Places of Power?

A Place of Power (also known as PoP or pop) is an immobile structure that will
generate prestige each turn for whoever controls it, along with providing
healing to adjacent legions. Some may also have special abilities which grant
other bonuses.

## Place of Power Stats

Places of Power begin with a predetermined array of stats, however these can
change over the course of a match whether it be through Promotions, Edicts, or
Rituals.

**Level**: A Place of Power's level determines how many attachment slots it has
and increases resistance to hostile rituals that target it. Places of Power can
gain promotions like legions.

**Hit Points**: HP determines the amount of damage a Place of Power can take
before being captured. While rituals can damage or reduce the max hp of a Place
of Power, they cannot bring it below 1 hp, thus they cannot capture it. Places
of Power cannot be destroyed, outside of certain special abilities.

**Combat Stats**: The Ranged, Melee, and Infernal stats determine the strength
of a legion in each of the respective combat phases.

**Special Abilities**: Some Places of Power have innate special abilities, and
they can be granted abilities through attachments. These abilities usually
provide out of combat bonuses for the owner.

**Prestige**: All Places of Power provide a certain amount of Prestige for the
owner. This can be modified with certain Edicts and Artifacts.

**Attachment Slots**: Places of Power can have a number of attachment slots
equal to half their level rounded up, to a maximum of four slots. Attachments
can grant powerful bonuses and abilities. See [Attachments][attachments] for
more details.
