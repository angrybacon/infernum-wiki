## What is the Bazaar?

The Infernal Bazaar offers a variety of Legions, Praetors, Artifacts, and Manuscripts that can be purchased through a match. Each item will have a minimum bid of tribute, though if multiple Archfiends attempt to purchase an item in the same turn, only the highest bid will be deducted and receive the item. All types of tribute are equal for calculating bids. Tied bids are broken first by Rank, and then by priority of the Order that the bid was made. All purchased items will be received after all Orders have resolved in the turn resolution.

Purchased Legions will be spawned on a canton closest to the stronghold. If there are no controlled cantons, the Legion will not be received.
Purchased Praetors, Artifacts, and Manuscripts will go directly to the vault. These are not immediately visible and rival Archfiends will not know who purchased the item, unless they have enough Prophecy.

Certain items will always use specific tribute types. Praetors will require souls and ichor. Artifacts of Pride will require souls and darkness, Artifacts of War will require souls and hellfire, while Artifacts of Sorcery may require a variety of souls, hellfire, or darkness.
