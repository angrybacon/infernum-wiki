## What are Praetor Duels?

Duels are an alternative to Vendettas. Instead of resolving conflict on the map 
through legions, Archfiends may instead choose to settle their differences 
through a Duel of Praetors.

## Initiating a Duel

Whenever an Archfiend can Declare Vendetta on a rival, they may instead 
challenge their rival to a Duel. Doing so will prompt for a choice of Praetor 
and a wager of prestige. Any owned Praetor may be submitted to a Duel, even if
attached to a Legion or Place of Power.

Note: Astaroth's Draconic Razzia does not count as a Vendetta and thus cannot
be used to initiate a Duel.

Once a challenge is made, the Duel process will resolve over the next few turns,
 as shown below.

## Fighting a Duel

The aim of the Duel is to get a higher damage value compared to your opponent.
The damage value in a Duel is calculated by adding the Praetor's level, the
strength value of the duelling technique selected and, if you submit and win the
bribe, your Charisma level. 

### Duelling Techniques

During a Duel, each Archfiend will select one of their Praetor's techniques to 
use. There are three types of techniques: Skulls, Orbs, and Serpents. They are 
able to cancel each other in a rock-paper-scissors relationship, as shown below.
This system takes priority over techniques which cancel opposing techniques as a 
special ability.

A cancelled technique does not provide any effects of its ability and does not
contribute its strength value to the Duel.

### Bribing the Arbiter

When selecting a technique, Archfiends with a Charisma of 1 or higher may also
choose to give a bribe of tribute to the Arbiter of the Duel. The Archfiend who 
gives the highest bribe will add their Charisma value to the Duel damage for 
their Praetor. Any bribes given are non-recoverable, regardless of the Duel 
result. All tribute types are weighed the same for bribery, only the quantity of
tribute is counted. If both bribes are tied, then there will be no damage boost
to either Praetor.

## Resolving a Duel

The Praetor who does the most damage will win the Duel. In the event of a tie, 
the Duel will be a draw. Damage done is calculated by Praetor Level + Technique
strength (if uncountered) + Ritual bonuses + Charisma (if bribe won). The
winner will take the prestige wager of both Archfiends. A Praetor who loses a 
Duel will be banished. In a draw, both Praetors will die, and both prestige 
wagers are lost. The turn log will display the results of the Duel to all 
Archfiends in the game. This includes the chosen Praetors, the techniques used, 
and any boosts from Charisma.

If a Praetor is not chosen for a Duel, or if a chosen Praetor is no longer
eligible to be used (due to being killed in combat, stolen, banished or given
away to an Extortion) before the Duel resolves, it will be considered a forfeit,
and the Archfiend will be penalized 10 prestige.

If both Archfiends' Praetors are not eligible to fight in the duel, both
Archfiends are penalised prestige and the initiator is declared the technical
loser.

Praetor Duel results are public and all Archfiends are able to see the Praetors
involved, the result, but not the moves chosen or the values presented.

## Example Duel

Andromalius has their Demand refused by Lilith and decides to challenge Lilith
to a Praetor Duel.

Andromalius selects their Praetor Astarte as their duelist and submits their
decision. Astarte is level 3.

Lilith is notified of the Duel and selects their Praetor Baraquiel to be their
duelist. Baraquiel is also level 3.

During this turn, Andromalius uses their Dark Art ritual, Vanity's Annointed
on their Praetor. 

Both Archfiends now need to select what technique they wish to use.

Astarte has two, Bleeding Wound, a Skull technique which deals 3 damage and
Splintering Parry, a Snake technique which deals 1 damage.

Baraquiel has three, Splintering Parry, a Snake technique which deals 2 damage, 
Infernal Blast, an Orb technique which deals 3 damage and Seal of Repudiation,
another Orb technique which deals 2 damage.

Andromalius selects Bleeding Wound for Astarte, they select the higher damage 
option which is also strong against the two Orb options from their opponent. 
Lilith selects Splinter Parry for Baraquiel. She suspect Andromalius will use
their highest damage technique.

Both Archfiends have enough Charisma to be able to bribe the Arbiter. 
Andromalius elects to bribe 3 tribute worth of tokens. Lilith elects to bribe 2
tribute worth of tokens.

Astarte's dueling technique is cancelled due to the rock-paper-scissors counter
and Andromalius wins the bribe adding their Charisma (3) to the fight.

The duel calculation plays out as thus:

```
Astarte:
Level (3) + Technique (0 - Cancelled out) + Bribe (3) + Vanity's Annointed (2)
Total: 7

vs

Baraquiel:
Level (3) + Technique (2)
Total: 5

```

Andromalius wins the duel and Baraquiel is banished.


## Excommunication

If either Archfiend involved in a Duel is excommunicated, the Duel immediately
ends without a result being applied.
