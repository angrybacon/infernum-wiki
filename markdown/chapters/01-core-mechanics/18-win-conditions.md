## What are Win Conditions?

There are three paths to win the throne of Hell: by election, by manipulation,
or by force.

## Trial of the Throne

Once a match reaches the set number of turns for its game length, an Assembly
will begin, consisting of five phases which last 5-13 turns total. Once the
Assembly has concluded, the player with the highest prestige will win by
election.

Note: If Pandemonium is held by a Usurper, the Assembly will pause. If it has
not yet begun, then it will only begin if Pandemonium is liberated.

## Manipulation Victories

Players may select relics for their chosen Archfiend prior to the start of a
match, two of which can steal victory from another player. In each case, both
you and the target must not be excommunicated.

Crown of the Kingmaker: You may choose another Archfiend as a puppet within the
first 10 turns. If your puppet would win by election, you win instead.

Power Behind the Throne: You must become a Blood Vassal to another player during
the course of the match. If your Blood Lord would win by election, you win
instead.

Note: If Kingmaker and PBTT would steal victory from the same target, the player
with PBTT will win the tie.

## Tyranny of the Usurper

Any Archfiend who takes Pandemonium become a Usurper. If the Usurper holds
Pandemonium for five turns, they win by force. If another Archfiend attacks
Pandemonium, they can choose to liberate the city, awarding a large chunk of
prestige and returning Pandemonium to a neutral state. If they choose to not
liberate the city, they become the new Usurper. For each new Usurper, the number
of turns required to win decreases by one, down to a minimum of zero (ie, the
second Usurper needs to hold it for four turns, the third for three turns, etc).

Note: Becoming the Usurper will result in immediate excommunication, and
Usurpers can still be eliminated by losing their stronghold. If the Usurper
loses control of their stronghold, Pandemonium will return to neutral.

## Triumph of the Abyss

If all surviving Archfiends are excommunicated and Pandemonium is still neutral,
Pandemonium will begin to crumble and lose half its stats each turn, rounded
down. If Pandemonium reaches a max hp of zero, the city collapses, ending the
match with no victor. During this period, if an Archfiend captures Pandemonium
to become the Usurper, the decay will pause and the standard Usurper rules will
apply.
