## What are Attachments?

Praetors, Stratagems, and certain Artifacts can be attached to Legions or Places
of Power, for various benefits. The number of attachment slots a Legion or Place
of Power will have is half its level, rounded up.

Any given Legion or Place of Power can only have a single attached Praetor.
Praetors usually confer combat modifiers, and some also have abilities which
provide bonus offerings if attached to a Place of Power.

Only Legions can have Artifacts of War, while only Places of Power can have
Artifacts of Pride. Artifacts of Wars provide combat modifiers and/or special
abilities which can drastically change the outcome of battles. Artifacts of
Pride will provide bonuses to powers, ritual strength/resistance, bonus
prestige, or other noncombat benefits.

Stratagems are single use attachments, which may be created by Archfiends who
have enough Wrath and tribute to pay for their cost. A stratagem consists of
tactics chosen at their creation, which impact combat stats or combat phases.
Improving Wrath will increase the strength of each tactic, unlock more choices
of tactics, and increase the maximum number of tactics on each stratagem.
Stratagems can be seen by rival Archfiends, however their tactics are hidden.
Stratagems only trigger during combat, thus stat boosts will not provide
support, nor will extra hp help against Destruction rituals.
