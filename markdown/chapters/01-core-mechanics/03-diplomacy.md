## What is Diplomacy?

As per the in-game Encyclopaedia: Diplomacy is the name we give to the threats,
offers and outright insults that fly through Hell's fetid air like carrion
birds.

Diplomacy is a way to control the flow of the game and provides a number of
options for initiating combat in the form of [Vendettas][vendettas] and ways to
either increase your Prestige at the expense of your opponent's or to offer
other diplomatic solutions to dealing with them.

## The Diplomacy Menu

Diplomacy is conducted within the Diplomacy menu on the top of the screen.

![Image of Diplo Menu](https://www.placehold.co/1920x1080 'Diplo Menu')

It displays all Archfiends in the game and their current diplomatic status to
one another. All diplomatic statusses are public information.

To initiate a diplomatic action with another Archfiend, select the Conduct
Diplomacy icon next to their portrait.

![Image of Conduct Diplo Icon](https://www.placehold.co/1920x1080 'Conduct Diplo Icon')

This menu will give a list of potential diplomatic actions you can perform with
the chosen Archfiend. Known information such as Prestige, Dark Art, Relics, Rank
and Powers of that Archfiend are displayed on the top right.

At the bottom of the menu, you will see each diplomatic action you can perform.
Select the action you want and click it to perform the action. Some actions are
only available at certain Archfiend Ranks. Some diplomatic actions may be
unavailable if you have insufficient Prestige to pay the cost of performing it,
or if they are on cooldown.

All diplomatic actions, except for sending a message, cost an order slot to
perform.

You cannot perform a diplomatic action, except for sending a message, to an
Archfiend with whom you already have some form of active diplomacy with.

### What is the prioritisation of Diplomatic Actions?

Except for messages, only one diplomatic action may occur between any two given
Archfiends at any one time. If two Archfiends both initiate a diplomatic action,
except for sending a message, against one another in the same turn, then there
is a hierarchy of prioritisation which determines which diplomatic action
succeeds.

1. **Archfiend Ranks**: rank is the most important factor in identifying whose
   diplomatic action goes through first. With Baron rank being bottom of the
   hierachy and Prince being at the top.
1. **Regency and Order Slot**: as with most other actions in the game, if two
   Archfiends of equal rank both perform diplomatic actions against one another
   in the same turn, then whoever placed their action earliest in the
   regency/turn/order slot order will have their diplomatic action succeed.

Let us look at some examples:

Erzsebet, a Princess wishes to Humiliate Beelzebub, a Baroness. Unbeknownest to
her, Beelzebub wishes to make a Request to be Vassalised to Erzsebet as they are
very aware of the difference in power. Beelzebub is the Regent and assigns the
_Request to be Vassalised_ diplomatic action in their first order slot.

Erzsebet is last in the turn order and assigns the _Humiliate_ action in their
fourth order slot.

Erzsebet's action will succeed as their rank is higher than Beelzebub's and as a
result, Beelzebub finds herself humiliated.

Another example:

Andromalius, a Dukex and Murmur, a Dukex wish to both perform an Insult against
one another in the same turn. Andromalius is the Regent but puts their Insult
diplomatic action in their second order slot. Murmur puts their Insult in their
first order slot. Andromalius, to their surprise, finds themselves insulted!

The Archfiend whose action does not succeed will have their order slot wasted
and a message informing them of the failure.

## List of Diplomatic Actions

[Praetor Duels][praetor-duels] and [Vendettas][vendettas] are covered in greater
detail in other chapters.

### Demand

Prestige Wager:

| Rank    | Prestige Wager |
| ------- | :------------: |
| Baron   |       8        |
| Marquis |       7        |
| Duke    |       6        |
| Prince  |       5        |

You demand an amount of tribute tokens from the target Archfiend. The number of
tribute tokens you can demand is determined by your Archfiend Rank. Barons can
demand 3 tokens, Marquis up to 4, Dukes up to 5 and Princes up to 6.

If the Demand is accepted, you will receive the prestige wager back, along with
the tokens selected by the targeted Archfiend. They must send the full amount of
tokens demanded, no matter what value those tokens are. If they are unable to
provide enough tribute tokens, they must reject the demand.

If the demand is rejected, the targeted Archfiend will receive your prestige
wager and you will have to select an option of either Claiming a Vendetta
against the target Archfiend, Challenging them to a Praetor Duel or Backing
Down. Backing Down means that no further steps occur as part of this action.

The full timeline of events for demand occurs as such:

MERMAID DEMAND TIMELINE

Demands have a cooldown of 3 turns starting from the turn the Demand was made
which is shared with the Extort action. Neither of these diplomatic actions can
be made to the Archfiend you targeted with them until this cooldown has ended.
Other diplomatic actions can still be made against the target Archfiend during
this cooldown (following normal limitations).

### Extort

Prestige Wager:

| Rank   | Prestige Wager |
| ------ | :------------: |
| Duke   |       8        |
| Prince |       7        |

Extort is only available to Archfiends of Duke Rank or greater. Extort is very
similar to Demand however instead of tribute, you demand your choice of either a
single artifact or single praetor from the target Archfiend.

If the Extortion is accepted, you will receive the prestige wager and the
targeted Archfiend selects one artifact/praetor (depending on your selection)
for you to receive. If they are unable to provide the asset selected (eg: they
do not have an artifact/praetor as required) then they have to reject the
extortion.

If the extortion is rejected, the targeted Archfiend will receive your prestige
wager and you will have to select an option of either Claiming a Vendetta
against the target Archfiend, Challenging them to a Praetor Duel or Backing
Down. Backing Down means that no further steps occur as part of this action.

The full timeline of events for extortion occurs as such:

MERMAID EXTORTION TIMELINE

Extortions have a cooldown of 3 turns starting from the turn the extortion was
made which is shared with the Demand action. Neither of these diplomatic actions
can be made to the Archfiend you targeted with them until this cooldown has
ended. Other diplomatic actions can still be made against the target Archfiend
during this cooldown (following normal limitations).

### Insult

Prestige Wager:

| Rank    | Prestige Wager |
| ------- | :------------: |
| Baron   |       5        |
| Marquis |       6        |
| Duke    |       7        |
| Prince  |       8        |

You send an Insult to a targeted Archfiend.

If the Insult is accepted, the target loses prestige and you gain prestige equal
to twice what you wagered.

If the Insult is rejected, the target must either declare a Vendetta against you
or challenge you to a Praetor Duel.

The full timeline of events for insults occurs as such:

MERMAID INSULT TIMELINE

Insults have a cooldown of 3 turns starting from the turn the Insult was made
which is shared with the Humiliate action. Neither of these diplomatic actions
can be made to the Archfiend you targeted with them until this cooldown has
ended. Other diplomatic actions can still be made against the target Archfiend
during this cooldown (following normal limitations).

### Humiliate

Prestige Wager:

| Rank   | Prestige Wager |
| ------ | :------------: |
| Prince |       10       |

Humilate is only available to Archfiends of Prince Rank.

You send a Humiliation to a targeted Archfiend. You must pre-select the
consequences as to what happens if they reject it when sending. You will have to
select an option of either Claiming a Vendetta against the target Archfiend or
Challenging them to a Praetor Duel and pre-determined the terms of the Vendetta
or the Praetor you wish to Duel with.

If the Humiliation is accepted, the target loses prestige and you gain prestige
equal to twice what you wagered.

If the Humiliation is rejected, the chosen consequences you selected immediately
take effect.

The full timeline of events for humiliations occurs as such:

MERMAID HUMILIATE TIMELINE

Humiliations have a cooldown of 3 turns starting from the turn the Humiliation
was made which is shared with the Insult action. Neither of these diplomatic
actions can be made to the Archfiend you targeted with them until this cooldown
has ended. Other diplomatic actions can still be made against the target
Archfiend during this cooldown (following normal limitations).

### Declare Blood Feud

Prestige Wager:

| Rank    | Prestige Wager |
| ------- | :------------: |
| Baron   |       10       |
| Marquis |       9        |
| Duke    |       8        |
| Prince  |       7        |

Declare Blood Feud can usually only be performed on a target Archfiend who you
have had 3 successful vendettas against.

You declare a blood feud with the target Archfiend. Once declared, the Blood
Feud continues until either party is eliminated (home stronghold lost) or
becomes a Blood Vassal.

The full timeline of events for Declare Blood Feud occurs as such:

MERMAID BLOOD FEUD TIMELINE

### Assert Weakness

Prestige Wager:

| Rank    | Prestige Wager |
| ------- | :------------: |
| Baron   |       6        |
| Marquis |       5        |
| Duke    |       4        |
| Prince  |       3        |

Assert Weakness can only usually be performed on a target Archfiend who has
accepted 3 consecutive Demand/Extort actions from you in a row. If they reject
any or if you perform the Assert Weakness action the "counter" resets to 0.

You Assert Weakness against a target Archfiend. You must select the option of
either starting a Vendetta against the target Archfiend or Challenging them to a
Praetor Duel and pre-determine the terms of the Vendetta or the Praetor you wish
to Duel with.

The full timeline of events for Assert Weakness occurs as such:

MERMAID ASSERT WEAKNESS TIMELINE

### Request to Be Vassalised

Prestige Wager:

| Rank    | Prestige Wager |
| ------- | :------------: |
| Baron   |       0        |
| Marquis |       0        |
| Duke    |       0        |
| Prince  |       0        |

Vassalage is a state whereby one Archfiend submits themselves under the rule of
another. As a Vassal you cannot initiate any diplomatic actions yourself (other
than sending messages) to other Archfiends. Instead you are tied to the
consequences of those your Blood Lord initiates. You you freely traverse through
their cantons with your Legions and any actions done by you, or against you,
will count towards vendetta victory conditions.

You request to become the Vassal of the target Archfiend.

If the target rejects your request, nothing happens.

If the target accepts your request, you become their Vassal, and they become
your Blood Lord. Any diplomatic actions you were currently part of immediately
end and the prestige wager of those actions returned to those who placed them.
All your current prestige is then given to your Blood Lord. At the end of the
game, in the final Trial for the Throne, half of any prestige you have is given
to your Blood Lord in the final turn.

You will remain the vassal of your Blood Lord until one of these conditions is
met:

- You, or your Blood Lord are excommunicated
- Your Blood Lord is eliminated
- Your Blood Lord accepts an Offer to be Blood Lord from another player

### Offer to Be Blood Lord

Prestige Wager:

| Rank    | Prestige Wager |
| ------- | :------------: |
| Baron   |       0        |
| Marquis |       0        |
| Duke    |       0        |
| Prince  |       0        |

You request for the target to become your Vassal.

If the target rejects your request, nothing happens.

If the target accepts your request, they become your Vassal, and you become
their Blood Lord. Any diplomatic actions they were currently part of immediately
end and the prestige wager of those actions returned to those who placed them.
All their current prestige is then given to you. At the end of the game, in the
final Trial for the Throne, half of any prestige they have is given to you in
the final turn.

### Send Emmissary

Prestige Wager:

| Rank    | Prestige Wager |
| ------- | :------------: |
| Baron   |       4        |
| Marquis |       3        |
| Duke    |       2        |
| Prince  |       1        |

Send Emissary is a diplomatic action that allows you to offer tribute tokens in
return for a diplomatic armstice between you and the target Archfiend. During
the Armstice period, neither you or the target may send diplomatic actions to
one another.

You must send at least one tribute token.

The length of the Armstice scales with the amount of tribute gifted. The Rank of
the Archfiend sending the emmissary increases the number of turns the Armstice
lasts.

There is an upper limit of 11 turns the Armstice can last.

The rank base for number of turns (based of sending a single tribute token of 1
value:

| Rank    | Armstice Base |
| ------- | :-----------: |
| Baron   |       1       |
| Marquis |       1       |
| Duke    |       2       |
| Prince  |       3       |

Currently the ratio of tribute offerred compared to length of Armstice is not
known.

If the Emmissary is accepted, you get your prestige wager back, the target
Archfiend receives the tribute tokens you selected and you and the target
Archfiend enter an Armstice.

If the Emmissary is rejected, the tribute tokens are returned to you and the
targets gets your prestige wager. No further actions occur.

If the Emmissary is executed, the tribute tokens are returned to you and the
targets gets your prestige wager and you will have to select an option of either
Claiming a Vendetta against the target Archfiend, Challenging them to a Praetor
Duel or Backing Down. Backing Down means that no further steps occur as part of
this action.

The full timeline of events for Send Emmissary occurs as such:

MERMAID SEND EMMISSARY TIMELINE

### Chains of Avarice

Prestige Wager:

| Rank    | Prestige Wager |
| ------- | :------------: |
| Baron   |       5        |
| Marquis |       5        |
| Duke    |       5        |
| Prince  |       5        |

Chains of Avarice is a Dark Art unique to the Archfiend Mammon. It is a
diplomatic action that may be used against another Archfiend.

If accepted, the target draws and keeps an additional tribute token every time
they perform a Seek Tribute action. Any tokens not kept by an Archfiend bound by
Chains of Avarice is given to Mammon, consolidated as a single token. The
agreement lasts 5 turns.

If rejected, nothing happens and the diplomacy is ended.

You may send Chains of Avarice to any number of Archfiends at once.

There is no cooldown to when you may next use Chains of Avarice on the same
Archfiend.

The full timeline of events for Chains of Avarice occurs as such:

MERMAID CHAINS OF AVARICE TIMELINE

### Draconic Razzia

Prestige Wager:

| Rank    | Prestige Wager |
| ------- | :------------: |
| Baron   |       15       |
| Marquis |       15       |
| Duke    |       15       |
| Prince  |       15       |

Draconic Razzia is a Dark Art unique to the Archfiend Astaroth. It is a
diplomatic action that allows a single turn of combat, as if a Vendetta was
active, to be enforced.

You notify the target of your Draconic Razzia. They have a turn to prepare a
response to it and then the turn after, you and the target are engaged in a
single turn of vendetta conditions (Legions may fight, you may capture cantons,
conquer each other's Places of Power and use Destruction rituals unmasked on
each other). Unlike a vendetta, there is no direct objective to complete and the
Razzia will end after one turn. That means it does not count towards a Blood
Feud.

You may only send a Draconic Razzia to one target at a time and it has a
cooldown of 5 turns before it may be used again against any target.

The full timeline of events for Draconic Razzia occurs as such:

MERMAID DRACONIC RAZZIA TIMELINE

### Lure of Excess

Prestige Wager:

| Rank    | Prestige Wager |
| ------- | :------------: |
| Baron   |       10       |
| Marquis |       10       |
| Duke    |       10       |
| Prince  |       10       |

Lure of Excess is a Dark Art unique to the Archfiend Erzsebet. It is a
diplomatic action that creates a 5 turn Armstice where neither you, or your
target may target each other with diplomatic actions. In addition, your legions
may walk through the target's cantons as if they were your own (however you may
not capture them or engage in combat with any legions or places of power owned
by your target.

If the Lure of Excess is accepted, you have your prestige wager returned to you,
your legions may enter the targets territory for 5 turns, your legions heal from
the target's Stronghold and Places of Power.

If the Lure of Excess is rejected, you lose your prestige wager and the target
loses 10 prestige. No other actions occur.

You may only send a Lure of Excess to one target at a time and it has a cooldown
of 5 turns before it may be used again against any target.

The full timeline of events for Lure of Excess occurs as such:

MERMAID LURE OF EXCESS TIMELINE

### Vile Calumny

Prestige Wager:

| Rank    | Prestige Wager |
| ------- | :------------: |
| Baron   |       5        |
| Marquis |       5        |
| Duke    |       5        |
| Prince  |       5        |

Vile Calumny is a Dark Art unique to the Archfiend Belial. It is a diplomatic
action that frames one Archfiend for insulting the target Archfiend. This
diplomatic action is unique insofar as although you send it to a target, after
sending it stops being a diplomatic action between you and the target and
becomes a diplomatic action between the target and the Archfiend being framed.

You cannot frame yourself.

Because of how Vile Calumny works, you can in fact "block/cancel" both the
target Archfiend's diplomatic actions towards you in the same turn and the
target Archfiend's/framed Archfiends diplomatic actions towards each other in
the same turn. This seems to ignore the usual priority based on Rank/turn order.

After the initial turn of sending the Vile Calumny, you may perform other
diplomatic actions against your target as normal.

If the false insult is accepted, your prestige wager is returned, the framed
Archfiend receives prestige equal to the prestige wager and the target and
framed Archfiend cannot use Insult or Humiliate diplomatic actions against one
another for 3 turns.

If the false insult is rejected, the target gains prestige equal to the prestige
wager and must declare a Praetor Duel or declare a Vendetta against the framed
Archfiend.

You may only send a Vile Calumny to one target at a time and it has a cooldown
of 5 turns before it may be used again against any target.

The full timeline of events for Vile Calumny occurs as such:

MERMAID VILE CALUMNY TIMELINE

### Send Message

Send Message is a special diplomatic action that doesn't have a prestige wager
and does not use up an order slot. You can send a single message to each (player
controlled) Archfiend each turn. Messages have a character limit of 666
characters.

Messages are not shown on the diplomacy screen and you cannot see any messages
between other rival Archfiends in the game.

## Excommunication

If an Archfiend is excommunicated, all diplomatic actions and diplomatic
statuses are immediately ended and they cannot engage in any Diplomacy nor can
any Archfiends engage in Diplomacy with the excommunicated Archfiend.
