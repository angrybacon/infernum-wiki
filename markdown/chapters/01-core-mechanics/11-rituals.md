## What are Rituals?

Rituals are single-use or continuous powers that are activated from your Ritual
Chamber that can be found on the upper central bar.

 - Screenshot of Ritual Chamber Icon - 

Rituals are obtained from either Archfiends as part of their [Dark Arts](Link
to Dark Arts Page), levelling up [Powers](Link to Powers Page) or [Artifacts of
Sorcery](Link to Artifacts Page).

## Performing a Ritual

Performing a Ritual requires an empty Ritual slot. All players start with 1
Ritual slot available by default. Ritual slots are unlocked by increasing your
Prophecy power with one slot gained at Prophecy 2, 4, 5, and 6 to a maximum of 5
slots.

A list of all your available Rituals is presented on the left hand side of the
Ritual Chamber. You can also filter by Ritual type (Artifact, Wrath, Deceit,
Prophecy, Destruction and Charisma) by selecting the appropriate icon at the
bottom of the screen.

To perform a Ritual, select it from the left hand side and drag it onto an empty
Ritual slot. If you have insufficient tribute to pay for it, then a pop-up
message will inform you as such.

Once successfully assigned to the slot, any applicable targets will need to be
chosen. Some Rituals target Legions, Places of Power or Cantons on the board,
others target opposing Archfiends or their other assets directly. Some Rituals
do not require targets.

Once all applicable targets have been selected you will then need to pay any
[tribute costs] as per normal.

Performing a Ritual requires an [Order Slot](Link to Order Slot Page).

## Continuous Rituals

Some Rituals are Continuous Rituals. These are denoted by a symbol on their
Ritual card.

Continuous Rituals stay in place each turn until their cost is no longer paid.
Only the first performing of a Continuous Ritual requires an order slot, paying
the upkeep cost for it does not. Continuous Rituals still take up a Ritual Slot
in the Ritual Chamber.

A Continuous Ritual will retain its effect until it is no longer paid for. It
will then last until the end of that turn, before ending and freeing up the
Ritual Slot.

## Ritual Strength & Ritual Resistance

All Rituals which are performed on opposing Archfiends or their assets will be
contested. Contesting Rituals will involve comparing your strength in the
Ritual's power type against their resistance in the Ritual's power. So for a
Deceit Ritual being performed on an opposing Archfiend it will compare your
Deceit against their Deceit for the purposes of Ritual Strength and Resistance.

There is also an element of randomisation in a contested Ritual, which is
currently unknown.

 - Strength vs Resist picture from encyclo in game - 

Strength and Resistance can be modified through various factors including Places
of Power, Strongholds, Rituals, Relics, and Artifacts.

For Archfiends, Ranks are used for level. Each Rank above Baron grants +1 Ritual
Resistance to a maximum of +3.

For assets with a level such as Legions, Praetors and Artifacts, each level above
1 grants +1 additional Ritual Resistance.

Additional Ritual Strength or Resistance bonusses outside of Power, asset level
or Archfiend rank are capped at a maximum of +6.

So the calculation is:

```
   Power + Strength Bonusses vs Power + Rank/Asset Level + Resistance Bonusses

```

There is also some level of randomisation that occurs as well, likely a die roll
on each side which adds some uncertainty to the result.

Let's work through some examples below:

### Strength vs Resistance Examples

Belial, a Marquis with a Deceit of 4 wishes to perform Loot the Vaults on their
rival Mammon, a Baron with a Deceit of 1. Neither have any applicable Relics or
Artifacts which boost their Ritual Strength or Resistance.

Belial's Ritual Strength is calculated as such:

| Belial              | Ritual Strength Bonus | Ritual Resistance Bonus |
| ------------------- | :-------------------: | :---------------------: |
| Power Level (4)     |           4           |            4            |
| Rank (Marquis)      |           0           |            1            |
| Belial's Stronghold |           1           |            0            |

You can see here Belial's Stronghold grants +1 Deceit Strength which is added
here. Belial's rank (Marquis) would only help his Ritual Resistance and is not
applied to his Strength.

Mammon's Ritual Resistance is calculated as such:

| Mammon          | Ritual Strength Bonus | Ritual Resistance Bonus |
| --------------- | :-------------------: | :---------------------: |
| Power Level (1) |           1           |            1            |
| Rank (Baron)    |           0           |            0            |

Thus, Belial has a Ritual Strength of 5 vs a Ritual Resistance of 1. In this
example Belial is favoured to succeed.

Another example:

Murmur, a Princex with a Destruction of 6 wishes to perform Infernal Affliction
III on 10,000 Screaming Bastards, a Legion controlled by their Rival Astaroth, a
Duke with a Destruction of 3. Murmur controls the Vats of Torment but little
does Murmur know that Astaroth has currently got the Ritual Evil Ward I active
and has the Ring of the Arcane in their reliquary. The 10,000 Screaming Bastards
have been busy on the field and are currently level 4.

Mumur's Ritual Strength is calculated as such:

| Murmur          | Ritual Strength Bonus | Ritual Resistance Bonus |
| --------------- | :-------------------: | :---------------------: |
| Power Level (6) |           6           |            6            |
| Rank (Princex)  |           0           |            3            |
| Vats of Torment |           2           |            0            |

Astaroth's Ritual Resistance is calculated as such:

| Astaroth           | Ritual Strength Bonus | Ritual Resistance Bonus |
| ------------------ | :-------------------: | :---------------------: |
| Power Level (3)    |           3           |            3            |
| Legion Level (4)   |           0           |            3            |
| Evil Ward I        |           0           |            2            |
| Ring of the Arcane |           1           |            2            |

Note because the Ritual is targeting Astaroth's legion and not Astaroth himself,
his rank is not counted in the equation, the legion's level is used instead.

Thus, Murmur has a Ritual Strength of 8 vs a Ritual Resistance of 10. In this
example, Astaroth is favoured to resist.

## Artifact Rituals

Artifacts of Sorcery provide you with the ability to perform Rituals from them.
To use these Rituals, the Artifact must be assigned to a Ritual slot as if you
were performing them as Rituals. These Artifacts, once purchased, are available
as part of your normal Ritual pool.

Equipping an Artifact of Sorcery costs an order slot just like performing any
other Ritual.

Once the Artifact of Sorcery is equipped, it will not have an upkeep cost and
will stay active in that Ritual Slot until it is removed.

As long as the Artifact of Sorcery is equipped, you will have access to
performing any Rituals it provides. These are performed just like any other
Ritual, paying tribute costs and using an order slot and require an additional
free Ritual slot to assign to (they cannot share the one the Artifact is
equipped to).

## Ritual Masking

After getting a Deceit of 3 or greater, an Archfiend may use the Masking Mirror
to hide their identity when performing a Ritual. Use of the Masking Mirror costs
additional tribute and it can be toggled on or off as needed.

Many rituals require you to be engaged in an active Vendetta or Blood Feud
against a rival Archfiend however masking your Rituals allows you to get around
that requirement.

Masked rituals are performed in exactly the same ways as other rituals however
there is an additional contesting of your Ritual power against the opposing
Archfiend's power as if there was a second Ritual being performed on them.

- Picture of Mirror - 

## Ritual Framing

Ritual framing works in the same way as Ritual masking, but instead of merely
hiding that it was you who perform a ritual, it instead allows you to present it
as if a chosen Archfiend was the one who performed the Ritual instead. If the
Framing is not discovered then the chosen Archfiend will receive any
consequences of the Ritual's actions including things like Excommunication.

## The Scrying Bowl

After getting a Prophecy of 1 or greater, the Scrying Bowl is unlocked. The
Scrying Bowl gives an assessment of how likely a Ritual is to succeed which is
shown when trying to perform it.

The higher your Prophecy, the more accurate your Scrying Bowl assessment is
likely to be. The more information you know about your target (perhaps through
the Dark Augury Ritual), the more accurate an assessment the Scrying Bowl can
make.

It will give you a series of success statements based on the information
available.

"Very Likely"
"Likely"
"Coin Flip"
"Unlikely"
"Very Unlikely"

It will also give you a reliability score of "Reliable" or "Unreliable" based on
the amount of information available to calculate the target's Ritual Resistance.

If you are employing Ritual Masking or Ritual Framing it will also give an
estimation on how likely your Framing/Masking is to be discovered ranging from
"Very Low" to "Very High".
