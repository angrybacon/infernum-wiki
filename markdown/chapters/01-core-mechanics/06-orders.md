## What are Orders / Order Slots?

Almost every action within the game is classified as an Order. To be able to
perform an Order, an empty Order Slot is required. Order Slots are the primary
limitation to how many actions an Archfiend can perform each turn. Your Order
Slots are shown in the bottom right hand corner of your in-game screen.

## Increasing Order Slots

By default, each Archfiend at the start of a game will have 2 Order Slots.

There is a Relic, the Crown of Bureaucracy, which starts an Archfiend off with
an additional Order Slot available.

Increasing any Power to 4 will unlock an additional Order Slot for each power
increased this way.

There is an Artifact, the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, which you can purchase and
attach to your Stronghold or Place of Power for +1 Order Slot.

You may only ever have up to 6 Order Slots total from any number of sources.

## Importance of Order Sequencing

The sequencing in which you place your Orders is very important depending on
what actions you wish to perform, the efficacy of some of those Orders, the
possible regency/turn order and what other Archfiends are doing can all feed in
to how your Orders play out.

Some key examples as to why Order sequencing matters:

- Gather Tribute actions give increased Tribute Quality the earlier they are
  performed in your Order Slots.
- If a target legion moves before your Forged Orders ritual is performed, it
  will have no effect.
- Two Archfiends of equal Rank wish to make a Demand of each other. Only the
  Archfiend who submitted their Demand earlier in the turn sequence has it go
  through.
- Two Archfiends try to take a neutral Place of Power in the same turn. The
  first Archfiend weakens it but does not caputure it allowing the second
  Archfiend to take it.

Any Order that becomes invalid due to another Archfiend's actions does not occur
and is wasted.

## The Regency

The Regency is the turn order and the order of priority in how turns are
resolved. The current Regent is highlighted in the top right of the game screen
and within the Diplomacy menu.

Each turn, the regency cycles along by one Archfiend in the order shown until it
loops round again back to the first Archfiend who was Regent.

Because of the nature of the Regency, you will always have a diplomatic and
Order advantage of the Archfiend immediately following on from you in the turn
order as there will only be a single turn in each Regency cycle where that
Archfiend will go before you in the turn order (when they are the Regent).
Conversely, you will always have a disadvantage against the Archfiend
immediately before you in the turn order for the same reason. As a result you
should pick your battles wisely.

## Turn Resolution Priority

Turns are played out based on Regency/turn order and based on Order Slot
sequencing.

Let's look at an example for a 4 player game:

- It is turn 1 of a new game
- Player A is the Regent for the turn
- The turn order is Player A &rarr; Player B &rarr; Player C &rarr; Player D
- Player C has the Crown of Bureaucracy

1. Player A's first Order Slot happens
1. Player B'S first Order Slot happens
1. Player C's first Order Slot happens
1. Player D's first Order Slot happens
1. Player A's second Order Slot happens
1. Player B'S second Order Slot happens
1. Player C's second Order Slot happens
1. Player D's second Order Slot happens
1. Player C's third Order Slot happens

Additional Order slots beyond the first 2 are always resolved after the others.

For turn 2 of the game, the resolution would look like this:

1. Player B's first Order Slot happens
1. Player C'S first Order Slot happens
1. Player D's first Order Slot happens
1. Player A's first Order Slot happens
1. Player B's second Order Slot happens
1. Player C'S second Order Slot happens
1. Player D's second Order Slot happens
1. Player A's second Order Slot happens
1. Player C's third Order Slot happens

### Other Turn Resolution Factors

There are other parts of the game which occur outside of the Archfiend turn
sequence. These include the following non-exhaustive list of events:

- Neutral legion/titan movement such as Abyssal Striders or the Leviathan
- Additional Abyssal Striders spawning
- Event cards taking effect
- Praetor Duel resolution
- Vendetta resolution
- Canton ownership changes
- Prestige awards for Place of Power
- Bidding resolution
- Edicts taking effect
- Receipt of tribute tokens or other assets from diplomatic actions

The exact ordering of these in-game aspects is not known other than they occur
after all player orders have been completed. The ones that are known are as
such:

1. All Player Order Slots are resolved
1. All existing neutral legions move
1. Additional Abyssal Striders can spawn
1. Bazaar auctions are resolved (in Regency Order of purchase)
1. Event cards are resolved
1. Praetor Duels are resolved

There are likely other events from the wider list that are within this sequence
but at this time, it is unknown still.
