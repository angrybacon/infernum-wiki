## What is Vassalage?

Vassalage is a state whereby one Archfiend submits themselves under the rule of
another. As a Vassal you cannot initiate any diplomatic actions yourself (other
than sending messages) to other Archfiends. Instead you are tied to the
consequences of those your Blood Lord initiates. You may freely traverse through
their cantons with your Legions and any actions done by you, or against you,
will count towards vendetta victory conditions.

Upon becoming a Vassal, any diplomatic actions you were currently part of
immediately end and the prestige wager of those actions returned to those who
placed them. All your current prestige is then given to your Blood Lord. At the
end of the game, in the final Trial for the Throne, half of any prestige you
have is given to your Blood Lord in the final turn.

You will remain the vassal of your Blood Lord until one of these conditions is
met:

- You, or your Blood Lord are excommunicated
- Your Blood Lord is eliminated
- Your Blood Lord accepts an Offer to be Blood Lord from another player
