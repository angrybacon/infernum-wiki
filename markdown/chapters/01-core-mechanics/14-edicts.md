## What are Edicts?

Every 10 turns, an Edict will be presented to and voted upon by all remaining
Archfiends in good standing with the Conclave. Archfiends will be give a three
turn advance notice on which Edict they will be voting on. Policy Edicts will
require choosing between two effects, potentially affecting all Archfiends.
Candidate Edicts will require a choice of a rival Archfiend to be affected by
the given decree. On the following turn, the victorious choice will be
displayed, as well as what each Archfiend voted for. The number of votes each
Archfiend has is equal to their rank, starting at Baron with 1. Other sources
may also provide additional voting power.
