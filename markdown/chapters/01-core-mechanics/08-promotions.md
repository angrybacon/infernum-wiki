## What are Promotions?

Upon leveling up, or as a result or certain Events, a Legion or Place of Power
may gain the opportunity to take a Promotion. Despite being able to level up,
Praetors will never gain Promotions. During Promotion, a choice of three options
will be given to the player, each offering boosts to a random stat. For striders
spawned through the Raise Abyss Strider ritual, the initial stats have the
promotions applied at random.

## Promotion Upgrades

When promoting to level X, the possible upgrades are as follows:

- Max Health: X + 3
- Ranged: X
- Melee: X + 1
- Infernal: X + 2
- A pair of any combination of Ranged/Melee/Infernal: half of the above values
  combined, rounded up.

In addition to the above, the Legion / Place of Power will also receive an
additional attachment slot with which to assign Praetors, equip Artifacts of War
or deploy Strategems.

### Example Promotion

For example: the Macabre Host, a level 1 Legion wins a victory and becomes
level 2. The Legion is offered the following Promotion:

- +2 Melee and +2 Infernal
- +1 Ranged and +2 Infernal
- +4 Infernal

## Other Useful Notes

Certain circumstances may provide a high value Promotion, these will raise the
level by 2 instead of 1. When choosing options for Promotion, each option will
have values as if the Legion only gained a single level.

If a Legion or Place of Power goes over the limit required for promotion for
battles won, it will only promote once, and once the promotion is applied, it
will reset the required number of victories to 0 again.

For neutral Legions, Titans or Places of Power, no Promotion is applied until an
Archfiend takes control over that entity. At this point the promotion becomes
available.
