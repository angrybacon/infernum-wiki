## What is Movement?

Legions can be moved around the map using an Order, up to a number of cantons
equal to their movement stat. Legion movement is the only way to capture cantons
and initiate combat, thus it is the only way to capture Places of Power.
Attempting to move into a neutral or hostile Legion or Place of Power will
trigger combat. Movement cannot go through a friendly Legion, however a move
Order that goes through a friendly Place of Power will redeploy the Legion,
effectively teleporting it to a valid canton adjacent to the Place of Power.
This deployment will use up any further movement. A Legion may only have a
single move Order per turn. Some circumstances will halt any further movement in
the move Order, this includes moving into enemy territory without having a
hostile diplomatic status, moving into swamp or lava terrain without the
appropriate ability, or fighting a battle that results in a stalemate.

A Legion's movement stat may be increased through manuscripts or the Infernal
Juggernaut Ritual. Certain events may reduce movement stats.

## Teleportation

Legions can also have the ability to teleport, which by default has a range of
three cantons. Teleportation bypasses any potential impeding terrain, Legions,
or Places of Power. A Legion cannot teleport directly into combat, any attempt
to teleport into an occupied canton will fail. Legions also cannot teleport into
ruin terrain. Any Legion which is in territory held by a hostile Archfiend who
stops being hostile will be teleported to friendly territory.
