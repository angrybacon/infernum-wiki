## What is Consolidation?

Consolidation is the act of combining multiple tribute tokens into a single
token with a combined value of all the tokens that went into it. For example:

You perform a consolidation of the following tribute tokens:

- 1 Souls
- 1 Souls
- 2 Hellfire
- 2 Souls
- 1 Darkness

This would give you a single tribute token worth 4 Souls, 2 Hellfire and 1
Darkness. If this token were to be used to try and purchase something from the
Bazaar, pay for a bribe or get stolen, the full, combined value would be used /
lost.

## When is Consolidation Useful?

Every purchase or action involving currency has a tribute token limit of 8
tribute tokens. Even if you have the correct value of tribute available in your
vault, because of the due bureaucratic process of Hell, if you cannot pay any
costs in 8 tribute tokens or less, you are not allowed to complete the purchase.
In this instance, you need to consolidate your tribute to reduce the number of
tribute tokens being submitted for the payment.

Consolidation can also protect tribute from being stolen. Actions such as the
Loot the Vaults rituals can only take _unallocated_ tokens from your vault and
any tribute tokens that have been assigned to be consolidated count as
_allocated_. But beware, depending on what order slot you place the
consolidation order, it may be at risk from being stolen. It is best placed to
perform any consolidation actions late in your turn orders.

## Limitations

Consolidation can be performed with as many, or as few tribute types as
possible. You can just make a tribute token with all Ichor, or one with a bit of
all four.

You can only ever make a token with a maximum of 9 of any one type of tribute.
This means the greatest value token that can be created within the game is the
following:

- 9 Souls
- 9 Ichor
- 9 Hellfire
- 9 Darkness

You can use already combined tribute tokens as part of a future consolidation
action.

Once a consolidation action has been performed it cannot be reversed. You cannot
split down tribute tokens into smaller pieces.

Consolidation also has the 8 tribute token limit. If you need to make tokens
that require more than 8 tribute tokens from your vault, you must perform
multiple consolidation actions.
