## What is Excommunication?

Pandemonium is the seat of the Infernal Conclave, and is guaranteed to appear in
every match. Attacking or damaging Pandemonium with a legion or ritual will
result in your instant Excommunication. A ritual which is resisted will not
result in Excommunication. Rival Archfiends can be framed for a ritual attack on
Pandemonium. However, due to its special ability, the success rate of framing is
capped at 50%. If the ritual succeeds but the framing fails, the framer will
instead become Excommunicated.

While you are Excommunicated, you cannot gain Ranks, send or receive Diplomatic
actions (other than Messages), vote on Edicts, act as Regent (unless all
remaining Archfiends are inelligible for Regency), access the Bazaar, or
mask/frame rituals. In addition, the restrictions on hostility both from and
against you are lifted. You are able to directly attack rival strongholds, and
others are able to do the same to you. Your cantons may be captured as if they
were neutral territory, and you may do the same to others. Archfiends in good
standing with the Conclave will support each other's legions against those who
are Excommunicated.

Excommunication can only be undone with the Writ of Rescindment Event, or by
choosing to liberate Pandemonium from the control of an Usurper.

If all remaining Archfiends are Excommunicated but Pandemonium is still neutral,
the Triumph of the Abyss will begin, leading to a potential game draw.
