## What is Tribute?

Tribute is the primary currency of Hell. It is represented by tribute tokens,
which may have anywhere from 0 to 9 of each of the four tribute types: souls,
ichor, hellfire, and darkness. These tokens are primarily acquired through the
seek tribute order. The number of tokens sought and kept is determined by rank,
and the tribute quality by highest power. Other sources may also boost tribute
quantity/quality. Seeking tribute in later order slots will incur a penalty of 2
tribute quality per each order that comes before it. Tribute can also be gained
through periodic offerings every five turns, or taken from rival Archfiends
through various means. Tribute is spent to upgrade powers, make purchases at the
Bazaar, cast rituals, and more.

## Paying Costs

For any single action, only eight tokens may be spent at once. More expensive
actions may require consolidation, an order which combines tribute tokens.
However, since a single token can have up to only 9 of each tribute type, any
extra that is consolidated will be lost. Also, an Archfiend may only keep a
maximum of 48 tokens total in their vault. More than that, and extras will be
lost at the end of the turn.

## Tribute Quality

Tribute Quality is primarily determined by your highest power. Higher Tribute
Quality will increase the amount of tribute in each token acquired through
seeking tribute, though the exact numbers are not currently known.
