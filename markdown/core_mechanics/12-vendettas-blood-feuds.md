## What is a Vendetta?

A Vendetta is a conditional state of war between two Archfiends. It is the
primary way for Archfiends to contest one anothers' territory, Places of Power
and gain Prestige via the outcome.

Vendettas are obtained/initiated through [Diplomacy]() and require certain
Diplomatic actions to occur.

Each Vendetta has a turn limit (between 1 and 8 turns) and an objective, both
chosen by the Archfiend who initiates the Vendetta.

Unlike normal, during a state of Vendetta, the two Archfiends involved may
freely traverse each others cantons, capture cantons from one another, engage
in combat between Legions and engage in combat and capture Places of Power.
Archfiends may also use unmasked Destruction [Rituals]() against one another
during a Vendetta.

As soon as a Vendetta ends, all hostilities immediately stop. Any Legions stood
in territory belonging to another Archfiend are teleported to a canton adjacent
to their Archfiend's own Stronghold.

## Vendetta Victory Conditions

Victory conditions are chosen at the start of a Vendetta. The initiator
specifies the condition and the number of turns with which to complete it. They
also specify a Prestige Wager which will result in a scaled Prestige return
based on the difficulty of the victory condition specified. 

Note: You can pay the minimum Prestige Wager for a Vendetta even if you do not 
have the Prestige to pay for it but may not increase it.

So for a Canton Capture victory condition of capturing 3 cantons in 2 turns, it
will pay out a much higher prestige return compared to capture 3 cantons in 6
turns.


### Canton Capture

The initiator selects a number of Cantons owned by the target Archfiend to be
taken during the Vendetta. This can be between 3 and 6 Cantons. Cantons are
captured by having one of your Legions end the turn on a canton which is 
adjacent to a canton you already own. Each canton captured during the Vendetta
will count towards the Victory Condition, even if you did not start the
Vendetta with that canton owned. 


### Places of Power Capture

The initiator selects a number of Places of Power owned by the target Archfiend 
to be taken during the Vendetta. This can be between 1 and 2 Places of Powers. 
To take a Place of Power, you must have your Legion reduce the health of it to
0 in [Combat](). Destruction rituals can be used to weaken them but you will not
gain control of the Place of Power unless a Legion takes it. Upon taking
it, you will gain control of any Praetors and/or Artifacts attached to it.

Each Place of Power captured during the Vendetta will count towards the Victory
Condition, even if you did not start the Vendetta with that Place of Power 
owned. 

If you take a Place of Power and it is taken back in the same turn cycle, it 
will still count towards the Victory Condition of the Vendetta.


### Destroy Legions

The initiator selects a number of Legions owned by the target Archfiend 
to be destroyed during the Vendetta. This can be between 1 and 2 Legions. 
Legions must be destroyed either through combat with your Legions or through
your Destruction rituals. Legions beign destroyed through Events, Legions or
Rituals controlled by other Archfiends or other factors do not count.


## Ending a Vendetta

A Vendetta immediately ends as a result of the following:

 - The Vendetta Victory conditions being met by the initiator. If they specify
   _Destroy 1 Legion_ and manage to do so, the Vendetta will end the turn they
   manage to destroy that Legion. In this case the initiator has successfully
   completed their Vendetta and will obtain the prestige reward accordingly.

 - The Vendetta turn limit ends. In this case the intiator has failed the
   Vendetta and the target Archfiend receives the Prestige Wager.

 - The Event card Paperwork Restructure is played cancelling all Vendettas which
   returns the Prestige Wager to the initiator.

 - One Archfiend involved becoming Excommunicated.


## What is a Blood Feud?

A Blood Feud is an unconditional state of war between two Archfiends. Once a
Blood Feud is claimed, a Vendetta-like state of hostilities will be active
between the Archfiends involved until the Blood Feud ends.

Blood Feuds are obtained/initiated through [Diplomacy]() and require certain
Diplomatic actions to occur.

During a Blood Feud, the two Archfiends involved may freely traverse each others
 cantons, capture cantons from one another, engage in combat between Legions and 
engage in combat and capture Places of Power. Archfiends may also use unmasked 
Destruction [Rituals]() against one another during a Blood Feud.

## Ending a Blood Feud

A Blood Feud immediately ends as a result of the following:

 - One or both of the Archfiends involved in the Blood Feud are eliminated from
   the game. This is achieved by their Stronghold being taken by another
   Archfiend or destroyed.

 - One Archfiend involved becoming the vassal of another Archfiend.

 - One Archfiend involved becoming Excommunicated.
