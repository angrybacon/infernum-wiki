## What is Combat?

Combat can occur on the map when a legion moves into the same canton as a 
hostile legion or Place of Power. A battle will then occur on the defender's 
tile.

## Combat Phases

By default, combat will occur over three phases in the following order: Ranged, 
Melee, and Infernal. In each phase, both combatants will compare their 
respective stat values, and the one with lower stats will take damage equal to 
the difference. 

So for example, if a Legion with a Ranged stat of 3 faces off against a legion
with a Ranged value of 5. The Legion with the value of 3 will take 2 damage.

### Additional Phases

If additional phases are added by an ability, for example "Ranged Twice", the 
new phase will be added immediately after the existing phase of the same type.

## Changes to Phase Order.

Some things can effect the order in which combat phases are completed. Things
like Legion abilities, Praetors, Artifacts and Strategems can have the potential
to alter the order. For example abilities like _Infernal First_ or _Melee Last_
can change the order that the phases occur. If an ability changes the order of
phases, all other phases will occur in their default order thereafter. 

For example: If a Legion attacks who has the _Melee First_ ability, then combat
will go Melee -> Ranged -> Infernal.
 
If multiple abilities change the order of phases, only the side with the higher 
level legion will take effect. If both legions are the same level, only the 
defender's side takes effect.

## Ending Combat

If either combatant is dropped to zero health after any phase, they are defeated
and combat immediately ends. Legions who are defeated in battle will be
destroyed whilst Places of Power that are defeated in battle will be transferred
to the winner's control, set at one hp. A victorious attack against a legion
will move the attacker onto their canton and attempt to resolve the rest of the
movement order, if any. If all phases resolve and neither combatant is
defeated, the battle is a stalemate, and any movement will be halted.

## Combat Support

Legions can also provide support to each other to bolster stats in combat. Any
friendly legion adjacent to the canton of battle (the canton where the defender
is place) will provide support to their side, adding half of each combat stat, 
rounded down. This includes legions of Blood Lords and Vassals, as well as any 
Archfiends in good standing against an Excommunicated rival. Places of Power do 
not provide support. 

For example: The Children of Belial are entering combat and have the following
statistics:

Ranged: 6
Melee: 1
Infernal: 7

They enter into combat and have a friendly Legion, the Iron Maidens supporting
them. The Iron Maidens have the following statistics:

Ranged: 6
Melee: 3
Infernal: 3

As a result the Children of Belial receive the following support buffs:

Ranged: +3
Melee: +1
Infernal: +1

This gives them the following stats in this combat:

Ranged: 9
Melee: 2
Infernal: 8
