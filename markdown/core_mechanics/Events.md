## What are Events?

Events are cards which have various powerful effects, some beneficial and some 
detrimental. 

When an Archfiend become Regent, they will draw a random event card
from the available Event deck. By default, Archfiends will only draw one card 
each time, and can only hold a max of one card at a time. Greater levels of 
Prophecy and other sources can influence these numbers. Event cards are unique, 
there will only be a single copy of any given card amongst all Archfiends and 
the Event deck. Once a card returns to the deck, any Archfiend may draw it 
again, even the same one who played or discarded it before.

Event cards may be played from your Sanctum by using an Order and paying any 
applicable tribute costs. 

Events will resolve after all Order slots have been completed in a turn cycle.
For more information on this see [Order Slots]().

Event cards may not be stolen or destroyed, only played or discarded back into 
the deck. 

Multiple instances of the same Event can be in effect at the same time. For
example 2 Angelic Hosts could be active on the board at the same time.

There is a Conclave [Edict]() called Dark Clouds Gather that can happen which
either allows all Archfiends to draw an Event card or causes all Archfiends to
lose a random Event card. The only way to prevent an Archfiend from playing 
an Event card is with the Malediction of the Seer Prophecy Ritual.
