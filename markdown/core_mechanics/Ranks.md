## What are Ranks?

There are four Ranks within the Infernal Conclave, ranging from least to 
greatest: Baron, Marquis, Duke, and Prince (exact titles may vary by the 
Archfiend's gender). By default, all Archfiends in a game start at Baron. During
a match, Prestige can be spent to upgrade an Archfiend's Rank one level at a 
time. The cost to upgrade increases for each susbequent rank with a cost of 30 
prestigae to upgrade to Marquis, 60 to upgrade to Duke, and 90 to upgrade to 
Prince.

## Rank Benefits

With each rank, different benefits are unlocked with either new options becoming
available or existing options getting stronger. 

Each higher upgrade in Rank will also provide one additional Resistance against 
Rituals directly targeting the Archfiend, and will have more advantageous 
prestige costs for their diplomatic actions.

Rank is also used for several tiebreakers in various contested actions, such as
diplomatic actions and Bazaar purchases.
