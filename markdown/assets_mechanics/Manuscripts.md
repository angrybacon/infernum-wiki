## What are Manuscripts?

Manuscripts are fragments of texts which may be found through the Seek 
Manuscript Order, or through purchase at the Bazaar. After collecting a certain 
number of pieces, an Order may be used to assemble the Manuscript for a special 
effect. Generally, the more powerful of an effect, the more fragments will be 
required to assemble the Manuscript. 

There are four types of Manuscripts, each with a different purpose: Manuals, 
Primers, Treatises, and Schematics.

Manuals will provide a Technique to a Praetor. This will overwrite the old 
Technique. The new strength will be the old strength increased by the number of 
fragments used. Note that without a certain level of Charisma, Manuals may only
replace Techniques of the same category (Skull, Serpent, Orb).

Primers will provide a boost to a Legion's combat stats or grant them a new 
ability. The boost to combat stats will be +3 for Ranged, +4 for Melee, and +5 
for Infernal.

Treatises will boost the specified power by two.

Schematics will reduce the specified power by two for all rival Archfiends.
